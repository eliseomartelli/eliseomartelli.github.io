VPNs are one of the preferred ways to tie-up multiple servers (and clients) together, but their nature becomes a **bottleneck** when the infrastructure to *link* becomes larger.  
A solution to this problem comes in the form of a software defined network **(SDN)**.

# Nebula Vocabolary

generate ca
generate key for node(s)
copy ca to our lighthouse
copy keys to other nodes
