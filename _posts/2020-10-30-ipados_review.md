What's an iPad? Is it a real computer? That's one of the questions Apple tries to ask and answer with its advertising.  
The truth is that you can consider it as a computer only if your use-cases match what Apple envisioned for it.

iPadOS is a fun computing platform designed for a touch-first interaction model, and let me get this straight: It excels at it.  
If you take a look at competing platforms like Windows, ChromeOS, or Android, you will see ecosystems that are far from perfect on tablets.  
These platforms are designed with input paradigms tied to a mouse and a keyboard or a smartphone interface.  
The iPad, on the other hand, is _distinctive_ and what sets it apart is the App ecosystem.  
This shouldn't be an invitation to Apple to stop fixing things or adding new features to the iPad. It's not a perfect device (more on this later).

## There's an app for that

The iPad platform offers a clean slate that developers are happy to use and develop for. The App Store is full of pretty good iPad apps.  
The quality of these apps is usually _top-notch_ and the often powerful chips on these devices help to deliver a smooth experience.

One of the most fascinating things as an Android user is that when Apple introduces a new framework or new hardware features, the developers are always keen on updating their apps to take advantage of these new features.  
There's always something _fresh_ on the iPad and each iPadOS update brings new features to the table.

### Productivity & Creativity

One of the main reasons I've bought an iPad is to run productivity apps.
Apple took a great stance with the introduction of the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard(s). The iPad has become a productivity-first device and not only another content consumption machine.

Apps like GoodNotes, Pretext, or Concepts feel right at home on the iPad. Starting from iPadOS 13.4, the addition of first-class mouse support on the iPad brought exciting new possibilities to this platform.

Creativity-oriented apps on the iPad are powerful yet simple. You will comfortably adapt from a keyboard and mouse workflow to the iPad since creating something on it requires less cognitive load.  
I'm a big fan of apps like Procreate (even though I can't draw). Keep in mind that developers are bringing more and more desktop apps to the iPad. On the App Store, you'll see names like Affinity Designer, Affinity Photo. There's even a slice of Adobe Creative Cloud apps on the iPad!
