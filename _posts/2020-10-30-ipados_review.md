What's an iPad? Is it a real computer? That's one of the questions Apple tries to ask and answer with its advertising.  
The truth is that you can consider it as a computer only if your use-cases match what Apple envisioned for it.

iPadOS is a fun computing platform designed for a touch-first interaction model, and let me get this straight: It excels at it.  
If you take a look at competing platforms like Windows, ChromeOS, or Android, you will see ecosystems that are far from perfect on tablets.  
These platforms are designed with input paradigms tied to a mouse and a keyboard or a smartphone interface.  
The iPad, on the other hand, is _distinctive_ and what sets it apart is the App ecosystem.

## There's an app for that

The iPad platform offers a clean slate that developers are happy to use and develop for. The App Store is full of incredible iPad apps.  
The quality of these apps is usually _top-notch_ and the often powerful chips on these devices help to deliver a smooth experience.
