Hello everyone!  
This year was so **great** for a lot of things...

In this post I will **highlight** the best things of this 2017.

Let's begin with something important:

**I've met the most beautiful girl of the universe** and yep, she's now my girlfriend and I hope our relationship will last forever.

I've **started** the _#UniversityLife_ and I **moved** from a little town to a big city.

This 2017 brought me to **work** on awesome projects with **awesome** people.

This year also **got me into:**
- Home Automation;
- Security;
- Crypto-coins.

And now, some bad news:

I was **involved** in a bad **car accident** but I'm ok, tho.  
Not a big deal!

### Future

I **can't predict** the future but I'm sure the next year will be as **awesome** as this one.

Happy holidays!
