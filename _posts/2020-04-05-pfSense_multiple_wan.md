Today's post aims at helping people that are working/studying from home and don't have a stable internet conection.  
Since me and my family are currently _staying at home_ we are __taxing our ADSL2+__ connection very hard with multiple simultaneous video conferences, so I had to find a way to keep all my family online.  
The way I've chosen to do that is by using __multiple WANs__, one of them being over __LTE__.

## Prerequisites

1. A pfSense box with __3+ network interfaces__;
2. A WAN and a LAN interface already configured inside pfSense;
3. A 4G/LTE modem that connects over ethernet.

If you already have the prerequisites sorted out, let's get to balancing!

### Configure the additional interface

1. Login to pfSense

### Setup a multi-gateway

### Configure the firewall to use the multi-gateway

### Let's get to testing!
