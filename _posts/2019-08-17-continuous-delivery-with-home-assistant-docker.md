Continuous delivery is a concept that's getting more importance lately with phones that are constantly updating or services that are always improving.

Why you'd leave your smart home out of this beautiful world?



Personal hubs, like Home Assistant, can be perfectly tied in a continuous delivery workflow because their configuration is made of text-files and VCSs are particularly good at "playing" with this kind of files.



To start this journey in the continuous delivery and/or integration we need to make our configuration replicable, to do that we need some sort of backup. Git and GitHub can help us with that (you can follow the official blog post here: https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/ecosystem/backup/backup_github/).

The continuous delivery part will be based on webhooks
