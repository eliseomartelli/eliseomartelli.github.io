Before we start talking about the benefits of _going cashless_ we need to talk about the reason behind this choice.  
Going _(almost)_ completely cashless ain't __easy__ and requires at least one rollback solution if something goes wrong (and yep, it __happens__).

As someone who loves tech but has a _love-hate_ relationship with money (especially with cash), going cashless means worrying less about the things you've in your pocket.

Going cashless means relying on payment services and below you can find a list of the things I use daily to fulfill my payments needs.

## Services I Use

### Apps

#### Micropayments (Below €10)

[Satispay](http://satispay.it){:target="_blank"}. 
I use **Satispay** regularly for my _day-to-day_ payments of small (and _not-vital_) things. 
It's a _small and dependable_ app that's available on both iOS and Android. 
But a payment app has the priority of being adopted and here, in Turin, a lot of places accept Satispay.

This app is like the _Venmo of Italy_.

#### Normal Payments (€10 - €100)

**Normal payments** make up the most of my monthly expenses and the 99% of them go through my phone.  
The main app I use for this kind of payments is [Intesa San Paolo Mobile](https://www.intesasanpaolo.com/) (my bank).  
The app is **sleek** and **modern**, supports fingerprint and **NFC** payments.  
Since the widespread adoption of NFC point of sales is **continuously rising**, NFC mobile payments are a well-made possibility that's secure and practical.

#### Big Payments (100€+)
For bigger payments I use a mix of techniques.  
While using mostly credit/debit cards, if the expense is recurring, I'll use **wire transfers.**

### Worst cases (and how I fix them)
Public transport tickets here in Turin can be a bit cumbersome for new-comers.  
You need to have a [BipCard](https://bip.piemonte.it/carta-bip-cose-e-come-funziona/) or some sorts of smartcard issued by your University (or workplace) then you can add bus tickets on that card.  
Paying for tickets can be done by going to a tobacconist (and using cash) or you can use the [GttToMove](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.to.gtt.tomove) and pay online (my preferred solution).
