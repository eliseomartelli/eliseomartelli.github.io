I'd like to kiss you on the corner of the street on a rainy day, close my eyes and imagine your eyes.
I'm sure that when I'll open them again your eyes will exceed my expectation.

I'd like to hug you in the warm of a bonfire, hold your hands and feel an heat that's stronger than the fire. 

I'd like to wipe your tears for you when we'll watch a sad movie.

I'd like to kiss your forehead when we'll have to go to bed. 

I'd like to love you forever. 
I love you.
