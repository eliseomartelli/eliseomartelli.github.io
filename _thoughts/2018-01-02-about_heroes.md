When I was a kid I thought that heroes were the best thing in the entire world (like most of us).  
Heroes were strong, heroes weren't afraid of anything.  
Heroes were heroes.  
And I've always wanted to be one of them.

One day, though, I saw one of my heroes crying.
I saw him thinking about his life, I saw him thinking about our life.  
In this exact moment I realized that everyone is an hero. You just have to believe in yourself and the people that love you.  
Follow your dreams, iterate, start again, and again, and again.  
Everyone could be an hero.

Believe in yourself and be your hero.
