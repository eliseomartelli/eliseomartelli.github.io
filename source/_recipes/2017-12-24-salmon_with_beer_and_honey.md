This is a recipe **I came up with** when my parents went to visit me in **Turin**.
It turned out pretty great.

They liked it so much.

This is the version I'm cooking for my family this **Christmas Eve.**

So, _let's get into it!_

## Preparation

1. Let's **start** with the preparation of this dish by pre-heating the owen at 180Â°C with the **fan-assisted** setting.

2. **Pour** the beer in a small pan with the **honey**. Put it on the cooker at the medium setting.

3. When it caramelises, add the **salt** and get it off the cooker and let it sit.

4. **Peel the potatoes** and wash them, then with a sharp knife (or a mandoline slicer) and **cut 'em** in thin slices.

5. Take a baking tray and put a sheet of greaseproof paper on top of it.

6. **Place** the salmon on top of the greaseproof paper, then **surround it** with the potatoes.

7. **Pour** the previously-prepared beer and honey mix on top of the salmon with a wooden spoon.
