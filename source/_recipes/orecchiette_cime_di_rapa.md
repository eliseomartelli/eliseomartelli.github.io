I try to find **soft** turnip tops so I don't have to throw away a lot of it.

4. **Wait** till the water starts to bubble up, then **add** the pasta.

5. **Prepare a pan** by **pouring** a table spoon of olive oil in it, **cut** the garlic and the anchovies and **throw** 'em in the pan.

6. **Put** the pan on the cooker and **start browning** the garlic and the anchovies.
