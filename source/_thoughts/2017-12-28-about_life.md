title: "About: Life."

Is the life something material?  
Are our lives only a way of proving our existence?

Life, for me, is a great present.  
A present I've to exploit, a present that I've to enjoy.

My first goal is to leave a great footprint here.  
It's not always possible, tho.  
It hurts.  
Life hurts.
