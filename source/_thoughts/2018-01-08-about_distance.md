title: "About: Distance."
---

Distance is something hard to get through. It's something human kind is not used to.  
Distance makes you enjoy every little moment with the people you love, it makes you enjoy people, it lets you understand the true meaning of love, the people that matters the most to you, the feelings you try to hide in your everyday life.

Distance is good but it's also a pain.  
Get used to distance.  
Understand who you love.  
Understand how to love.
