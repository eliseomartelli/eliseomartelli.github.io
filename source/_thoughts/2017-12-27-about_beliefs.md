Beliefs. That's what we stand upon. That's what I stand upon.
But what happens when one of them gets disturbed?
What happens when the things you believe in are slowly ceasing to exist?
Nothing isn't the answer.

There's something that's happening in my life that's changing the way I see things, the way I talk to people, the way I express myself.

I'm facing troubles, tho.
I think there's something wrong with me.
Maybe I'm not right.

Maybe.
