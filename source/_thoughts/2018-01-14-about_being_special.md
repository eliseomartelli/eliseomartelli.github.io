title: "About: Being Special."
---

Being special to someone is the biggest achievement one can make.  
It's not something that happens everyday but it's so meaningful and so nice that it became my first goal.

The unique feeling of being something special for someone quickly became my addiction.  
I love to help people, I love to make them feel special, I love being special for them.

Waking up and knowing there's someone who is special to you (or you are special to her/him) is the best thing ever.  
I'd love to feel like this everyday.

Is "special" gonna be "normal" one day?
