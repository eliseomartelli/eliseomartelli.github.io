Hello everyone!

This is my first **_"real"_** article after a long time.<br>
Today I'll talk about a topic I'm really enjoying lately.

**Smart Home** & Smart Home devices.

Who knows me personally is aware of what I like.<br>
If you don't know me here's a little list:
- My girlfriend;
- My family;
- My friends
- Food;
- Technology;

*In public I talk about technology, tho...*

My journey in smart home technologies started a while ago but since I moved to a new apartment (_#UniversityLife_), I had to re-do and re-think a lot of things.

My new setup should be:
- Portable;
- Unintrusive;
- Cheap.
