Smart Home companies these days are shipping products at a **_very fast rate._**

The downsides are:
- Prices are staying pretty steady;
- The entry point is fairly high.

### How much you have to pay to enter the "Smart Home" world?

A quick look at Amazon reveals that a [Philips Hue Starter Kit](https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B016H0R7SE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3414&creative=21718&creativeASIN=B016H0R7SE&linkCode=as2&tag=eliseomartell-21&linkId=df370ffb44cdb9846e9e07cf4088de63) costs about 80 euros, it's one of the most popular Smart Home kits but the price isn't the most accessible and it forces you to use the **"Hue _ecosystem_"**.

We can do it better. **We can build it.**
